#Researchers conducted a blind taste test of Coke versus Pepsi.

#The data was such that 3 of the 4 people chose Coke. Assuming that this sample is representative, 
#report a P-value for a test of the hypothesis that Coke is preferred to Pepsi using a one sided exact test.

# Suppose that 18 obese subjects were randomized, 9 each, to a new diet pill and a placebo. 
# Subjectsâ€™ body mass indices (BMIs) were measured at a baseline and again after having received 
# the treatment or placebo for four weeks. 
# The average difference from follow-up to the baseline (followup - baseline) was âˆ’3 kg/m2 for the treated group 
# and 1 kg/m2 for the placebo group. 
# The corresponding standard deviations of the differences was 1.5 kg/m2 for the treatment group 
# and 1.8 kg/m2 for the placebo group. 
# Does the change in BMI over the two year period appear to differ between the treated and placebo groups? 
# Assuming normality of the underlying data and a common population variance, give a pvalue for a two sided t test.
